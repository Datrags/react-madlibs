          Once upon a time, there was a Fuzzy guy named Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
          One day, Joe decided to visit the Nimble zoo.
    </p>
    <p>
          At the Zoo, the first thing Joe saw was a Giraffe eating Chickens.
    </p>
    <p>
          It was very Fragrant to see that!
    </p>
    <p>
          Next, Joe saw an Luminous Giraffe that was Jumping with a Nacho. 
    </p>
    <p>
          Joe laughed and said, "That's the most Zealous thing I've ever seen!"
